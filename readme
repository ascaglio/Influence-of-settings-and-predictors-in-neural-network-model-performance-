REPOSITOTY DESCRIPTION:

This repository holds the codes and data used for the manuscript "Influence of settings and predictors in neural network model performance: a Buenos Aires air quality case"
Authors: Ariel Scagliotti, David Margarit, Marcela Reale, and Guillermo Jorge

FILES: 

fnet: code for training of a multilayer perceptron feedforward and backpropagation neural network
som: code for training a self organizing map neural network 
input: input data with predictors for fnet
pm25acu: target variable for fnet training
data: xlsx with complete data 
input_som: input space for SOM training
quick_test: code for train a Neural Network for prediction of PM2.5 from PM10, with default parameters. 

QUICK TEST INSTRUCTIONS:
Before running the code, user must import to Matlab workspace files input.mat and pm25acu.mat
After running, the GUI appears to show training progress and final plots. User can change the number of hidden neurons (10 by default).
